How to run:
mkdir /cgroup
mount -t cgroup -o freezer,ns cgroup /cgroup
sh cloop.sh

cloop.sh continuously checkpoints, kills, then restarts
the 'crcounter' program.  Before restarting crcounter
from its last checkpoint, cloop.sh each time writes the
value '5' into the counter_out  file.  However the
crcounter program remembers the value it left off at,
and writes that into counter_out.  So, if the program
is being restarted, then the value in 'counter_out' will
keep growing, and you will keep seeing lines like:
	cnt is 9, counter_out has 9
in the output.

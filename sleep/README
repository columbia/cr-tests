This test still needs to be automated.  What I do right now
is
alias freeze='echo FROZEN > /cgroup/1/freezer.state'
alias thaw='echo THAWED > /cgroup/1/freezer.state'
# in terminal 1:
./sleep
# in terminal 2:
freeze
../ckpt `pidof sleep` > o.sleep
thaw
killall sleep
../rstr < o.sleep

Success means that the restarted sleep should sleep for
much more than 5 seconds.  If it only sleeps for 5
seconds, then the restart block was not properly set up.

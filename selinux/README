is in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

You also need to add 'restore' to the definitions of
all_file_perms, all_process_perms, all_ipc_perms, and all_msg_perms
in /usr/share/selinux/devel/include/support/all_perms.spt.  The
refpolicy source likewise must be updated to know of these perms.

Test sequence:

	1. load policy
	2. run ckpt as ckpt_test_1_t to create a checkpoint image
		with tasks etc under that label
	3. run restart as ckpt_test_2_t without KEEP_LSM, making
		sure tasks are under ckpt_test_2_t label.
	4. run restart as ckpt_test_2_t with KEEP_LSM, making
		sure tasks are under ckpt_test_1_t label.
	5. run restart as ckpt_test_3_t, which does not have
		restore rights to ckpt_test_1_t, with KEEP_LSM,
		making sure we get -EPERM.

Later we may want to also test file and ipc labels.

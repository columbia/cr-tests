This test still needs to be automated.  What I do right now
is
alias freeze='echo FROZEN > /cgroup/1/freezer.state'
alias thaw='echo THAWED > /cgroup/1/freezer.state'
# in terminal 1, either:
./userns_ckptme
# or
./userns_ckptme blah
# in terminal 2:
freeze
../ckpt `pidof userns_ckptme` > o.userns_ckptme
thaw
killall userns_ckptme
../rstr < o.userns_ckptme

If successful, one of the userns_ckptme tasks should
be running as uid and gid 501, the rest should still
be 0/0 at first.  Each task will wait for the one
it cloned, then set{gu}id(501), then output its pid
and uid to /tmp/userns.txt.

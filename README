This top-level directory contains:
	cr: checkpoint program
		usage: cr pid outfile
		or: cr > outfile
	rstr: restart program
		usage: cr infile
		or: cr < infile
	ns_exec: execute with new namespaces
	gettimeofday: test using gettimeofday syscall

See the README in each directory for how to use each test.

OR, to run the tests automatically, just type

make
bash ./runall.sh

To mount the freezer as needed for tests, you could do:

#!/bin/sh
cat > /bin/remove_dead_cgroup.sh << __EOF
#!/bin/sh
echo "Removing dead cgroup .$*." >> /var/log/cgroup
rmdir /cgroup/$* >> /var/log/cgroup 2>&1
echo "return value was $?" >> /var/log/cgroup
__EOF
mount -t cgroup -o freezer freezer /cgroup/
echo /bin/remove_dead_cgroup.sh > /cgroup/release_agent 
echo 1 > /cgroup/notify_on_release
chown -R ltp:ltp /cgroup
